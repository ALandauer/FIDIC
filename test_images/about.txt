Test images are synthetically generated. The reference image is seeded with randomly placed "speckles" of gausian
intensity profile.  Progressive deformation is simulated by moving pixels approperiately.  To test with a simple 
translation, place the images from the "translation" directory here, to test a uniaxial stress deformation place 
the images in the "stress" directory here.
