Description:  This package contains files for the Fast Iterative 
Digital Image Correlation algorithm 

Adapted from:
Bar-Kochba E., Toyjanova J., Andrews E., Kim K., Franck C. (2014) A fast 
iterative digital volume correlation algorithm for large deformations. 
Experimental Mechanics. doi: 10.1007/s11340-014-9874-2

The main example file to see how the package runs is exampleRunFile.m.

Notes: Please ensure that the only .mat files in the working directory are those pertaining to the current image set.
Tested on MATLAB 2015a & 2015b for Windows x64, MATLAB 2013a for Windows x64 (algorithm only), and MATLAB 2015b for CentOS 7.  For our purposes we have validated the code on the SEM 2014 DIC challenge images; use at your own risk.

Core files:
addDisplacements_2D.m
areaMapping.m
checkConvergenceSSD_2D.m
DIC.m
filterDisplacements_2D.m
funIDIC.m
IDIC.m
removeOutliers_2D.m

Example run files:
exampleRunFile.m
imageCropping.m

History:
0.14 - New image evaluation function: incorperates basic noise foor and displacement resolution assessment
       metices in the base workflow. 6/24/16
0.13 - Release with several improvements: new plotting routine used by default "FIDIC_plot.m" with
       built-in region of interest selction for rectangular areas, 
       added a normalized cross-correlation option (with validation).  05/20/16
0.12 - New public release with minor updates: use interpn if griddedInterpolant is not found, 
       tiff2mat is now img2mat. Updated example dataset.  01/08/16
0.11 - Update of example run file to delete the .mat file generated by tiff2mat.m after use, 07/14/15
0.10 - Beta release of DIC adaptation, 06/25/15
